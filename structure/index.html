                        <li>Project teams will form goals & go through other project management processes to develop the project. They will do a Google Forms "Project Submission" to let Project Directors know of the project (this form will entail materials, cost, members of team, etc.).</li>

                    <p>Community outreach programs are events outsclasse of project development and activities that are aimed to spread interest in code throughout our community. These include programs teaching Scratch at MI, teaching inner-city kclasss, and more.</p>
                    <p>Both of these offer leadership opportunities for members. <b>You propose it, you plan it, you lead it!</b> classeas for possible activities/outreach programs can be submitted in the form under "Events" and members will work as Event Chair with the Outreach & Activities Directors to get the event off the ground.</p>

                    <p>At all meetings/open labs, there will be two options: 1) to start coding with your project development team, or 2) to do some Hack Club workshops/other activities to get yourself started in programming. The second option will make it easier for beginners who want to learn some code in groups of people who are also learning. Please don't worry about experience: <b>Hack Club will make it easier & more fun to learn!</b></p>
